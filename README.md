# Off-by-One Error in Java While Loop

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in a Java while loop.  The `while` loop's post-increment condition can lead to unexpected loop iterations.

The `bug.java` file contains the code with the error, while `bugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.

This is a great example to illustrate the importance of careful loop condition construction in programming.
